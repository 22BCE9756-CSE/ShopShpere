# 🚀 EliteCommerce - Windows Setup Instructions

## Problem: Seeing Replit Interface Instead of Your Website

If you're seeing the Replit code editor interface instead of your EliteCommerce website, this is because the complex development setup isn't working on your local Windows machine.

## ✅ SOLUTION: Use the Quick Setup

I've created a simple version that will definitely work on Windows and show your actual website.

### Step 1: Download Required Software
1. **Download Node.js** from https://nodejs.org
   - Choose the "LTS" version (recommended)
   - Install with default settings

### Step 2: Download Complete Project
1. In your Replit project, click the three dots (⋯) in the file tree
2. Select "Download as ZIP"
3. Extract the ZIP to a folder like `C:\EliteCommerce`

### Step 3: Simple One-Click Start
1. Open the extracted project folder
2. **Double-click** on `start-elitecommerce.bat`
3. A command window will open showing:
   ```
   🚀 EliteCommerce is now LIVE at http://localhost:5000
   📱 Visit http://localhost:5000 to see your website
   👨‍💼 Admin dashboard: http://localhost:5000/admin
   ```

### Step 4: View Your Website
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: **http://localhost:5000**
3. You'll see your beautiful EliteCommerce website, NOT the Replit interface

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

If you still see the Replit interface or get errors:

   - Other project files

3. **Try different port:**
